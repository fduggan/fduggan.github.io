			<h1 style="color:green">First Impressions</h1>
				<p>"When I first met Faith I thought she was straight foward (holds no punches), Honest, cold, standoffish, patient (toleration the people around you). For me, you present yourself like a well mannered and typical teenager. By the way, I still thing theses thing about you but... and all the mushy thing that make me love and adore you." --YT</p>
			<h2 style="color:navy">Schools</h2>
				<p>It takes a while for people to tolerate me. When you first meet me I can be kind, happy, grumpy, annoying or all of them at once. It depends on how I slept, how annoying my sister has been, work load, parents, friends and normal everyday bs.In my 16 years of life I have gone to a grand total of 2 schools.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><a href="http://www.brickchurchschool.org/RelId/33637/ISvars/default/Home.htm" target="_blank">Brick Church School</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.nightingale.org/" target="_blank">The Nightingale Bamford School</a></li>
				</ol>
				<p>I have already graduated from Brick and I am going on my 12th year at Nightingale. I have laughed, I have cried, I have yelled, I have screamed, I have slept, I have eaten. I have lived and breathed Nightingale. Betweem the tunics, skirts, bird logos, and perfect uniforms I am a Nightingale girl. It is as if the Nightingale community has inject some sort of serum in my blood when I first walked through those big blue doors in a tunic, white sneakers and those white shirts and the puffy sleeves.I have learned to love and hate my school, I have learned to gossip and Judge, and I have also learned the quadratic formula.</p>
			<h3 style="color:maroon">Family and Friends</h3>
				<p>The good news is I have a family. The bad news is I have a family. Although most of the time I love the, love and hate is a thin line that the have cross. I have a sister, but I dont admit that in public. One Father and about 10 moms, a couple hundred aunts (all but two are not related to me), one (sometimes drunk) uncle, 2 grandmas, and hundreds of cousins. Of course, I don't know all my cousins but they are there. The reasons I have so many "aunts" is because I didn't get the best of realives, and the ones that had promise have passed away, so I choose my family. The photos below are pictures of my sometimes beloved family.</p>
