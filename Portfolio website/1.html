	"When I first met Faith I thought she was straight foward (holds no punches), Honest, cold, standoffish, patient (toleration the people areound you). For me, you present yourself like a well mannered and typical teenager. By the way, I still thing theses thing about you but... and all the mushy thing that make me love and adore you." --YT
	I know, and I'm cold. Truth be told I can be cold but that is only one side of me the other side of the quarter is the exact opposite. Happy, giddy, loving, even lovable. I'm no Chris and I am working on becoming Raymond.

	<div>About me from Me</div>
	<body>
	I am amazing; it takes a while for people to truly understand what a fantastic person I am. Depending on the person or the reason I am meeting them, I can reveal how complex I am from the stereotypical teenage girl. After people see my core, I like to surprise them and tell them that I am a hidden genius. Iâ€™m the one who changes tone, style, attitude and persona to make the first impressions great. Once they see how exceptional I am, I can slow embrace my core self and transform into the authentic me.</body>
