		<p>It takes a while for people to tolerate me. When you first meet me I can be kind, happy, grumpy, annoying or all of them at once. It depends on how I slept, how annoying my sister has been, work load, parents, friends and normal everyday bs. In my 16 years of life I have gone to a grand total of 2 schools.</p>

		</ol>
		<p>I have already graduated from Brick and I am going on my 12th year at Nightingale. I have laughed, I have cried, I have yelled, I have screamed, I have slept, I have eaten. I have lived and breathed Nightingale. Betweem the tunics, skirts, bird logos, and perfect uniforms I am a Nightingale girl. It is as if the Nightingale community has inject some sort of serum in my blood when I first walked through those big blue doors in a tunic, white sneakers and those white shirts and the puffy sleeves.I have learned to love and hate my school, I have learned to gossip and Judge, and I have also learned the quadratic formula.</p>
